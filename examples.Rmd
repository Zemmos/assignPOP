The following chunks of codes demonstrate how functions are used to perform assignment for different data types and tasks. Please change file and variable names accordingly. Use different argument values if desired. 

### Workflow 1. Evaluate genetic data from known individuals
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Import a GENEPOP file
geninfile <- read.genpop("YourGenepop.txt", pop.names=c("pop_A","pop_B","pop_C"))

#Reduce low variance loci (optional)
geninfile_rd <- reduce.allele(geninfile, p=0.95)

#Perform Monte-Carlo cross-validation (use subsets of high Fst loci as training loci, LDA to build predictive models)
assign.MC(geninfile_rd, train.inds=c(0.5, 0.7, 0.9), train.loci=c(0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1), loci.sample="fst",
          iterations=30, model="lda", dir="ResultFolder_MC/")

#Calculate assignment accuracy
accuRes_MC <- accuracy.MC(dir="ResultFolder_MC/")

#Make assignment accuracy boxplot
accuracy.plot(accuRes_MC, pop=c("all","pop_A","pop_B","pop_C"))

#Perform K-fold cross-validation 
assign.kfold(geninfile_rd, k.fold=c(3, 4, 5), train.loci=c(0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1), loci.sample="fst",
             model="lda", dir="ResultFolder_KF/")

#Make membership probability plot
membership.plot(dir="ResultFolder_KF/")

#Identify informative loci
check.loci(dir="ResultFolder_MC/", top.loci=20)

```
