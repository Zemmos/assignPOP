To more efficiently analyze large genomic data for population assignment, we have developed an R package, *assignPOP*, to help perform population assignment tests and understand whether the collected data can be used to build a robust predicting model. We employ several machine learning methods to the package, including Monte-Carlo and K-fold cross-validation for resampling training individuals, random and Fst-based subsampling for training loci, PCA for dimensionality reduction, and a variety of machine learning estimators for building predicting models. Not only our methodology helps speed up the analyses but prevents upwardly biased results that could occur when using some other programs (see Anderson 2010).    \r\n\r\n### Monte-Carlo cross-validation\r\n![MCCV framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexkychen/assignPOP/master/pic/Figure%201.%20Monte-Carlo%20cross-validation.png)\r\n\r\n### K-fold sampling\r\n![K-fold sampling](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexkychen/assignPOP/master/pic/Figure%202.%20K-fold%20sampling.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\n\r\n### References\r\n* Anderson, E.
